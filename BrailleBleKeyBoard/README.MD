## Remark

To utilize this feature, PSRAM must be activated. On development boards equipped with the onboard ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module series (utilizing 8-wire SPI flash/PSRAM), the GPIO pins GPIO35, GPIO36, and GPIO37 are reserved for communication between the internal ESP32-S3 chip and the SPI flash/PSRAM. These pins are not externally accessible if the PSRAM is Activated.
